Hi,
  
 the Panel.cfg and the ISG config file to go in the respective Panel Folder (e.g. Panel.GE) of the A300.
 You need to have the Thomas Ruth A300 and/or A310 with the VC and the payware ISG gauges properly installed.
  
 For P3D v4 you need to get the updated ISG gauge for it to work.
  
 Cheers
 Kosta
